## How do you play Poker Dice?

Each player takes a single turn and may roll the five dice up to three times, trying to roll the best poker hand they can. On any of the three rolls the player may set aside one or more of the dice, though they are never required to. The current player may choose to end his turn after the first or second roll.

If, at the end of the round, two or more players are tied to win, then those players should roll their turns again until a clear winner is established.

## How do you score?

The dice hands rank as follows (from highest to lowest):

- Five of a kind
- Four of a kind
- Full house (Three of a kind and a pair)
- Three of a kind
- Two pair
- One pair
- High card

Note: Straights do not count, and since there are no suits, there can be no flush.

Aces are high, then sixes, fives, etc.

And that's it. The player with the highest hand wins the game!
