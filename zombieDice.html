      <p>
        In Zombie Dice, you are a zombie. You want braaains - more brains than
        any of your zombie buddies. The 13 custom dice are your victims. Push
        your luck to eat their brains, but stop rolling before the shotgun
        blasts end your turn! Whoever collects 13 brains first wins. Each game
        takes 10 to 20 minutes and can be taught in a single round.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each turn, you take three dice from the box and roll them. A brain
        symbol is worth one point at the end of the round, while footsteps allow
        you to reroll this particular dice. Shotgun blasts on the other hand are
        rather bad, cause if you collect three shotgun blasts during your turn,
        it is over for you and you get no points. After rolling three dice, you
        may decide if you want to score your current brain collection or if you
        want to push your luck by grabbing new dice so you have three again and
        roll once more.
